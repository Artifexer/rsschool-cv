## Summary
I'm a student on the last course of IT University. Now I'm going to become a Front-End Developer till spring. I was working with C++ and Python for a little but useful programs for my study, now I learn JS and I hope RSS Front-End course will help me to get hard skills. Also, I'm working with Photoshop over 10 years for decoring my projects on YouTube or VK public pages. I'm very executive, polite and stress-resistant person. I graduated military training center with Lieutenant rank, so I'm pretty sure in this words.
